/* example_01_initialize_wam.cpp
 *
 * This is an example file that follows BarrettTechnology's exact example 1. 
 * I am using this as experience in writing code to control the WAM
 * 
 * This is the simplest possible program that runs Barrett Technology's WAM Arm
 * using the libbarrett controls library.
 *
 * Before running this program, make sure the WAM is powered on and connected to
 * the Control PC. It can be either E-stopped or Idled.
 *
 * This code initializes the arm, allows the user to Shift-activate (thereby
 * giving the robot permission to apply torques), and then (with a loop rate of
 * 500 Hz) commands the WAM to apply zero torque to all of its joints. Since the
 * motors aren't applying any torques, it will be easy to move the WAM by
 * pushing it. The arm won't move on its own, but, if it's not already resting
 * on its joint stops, gravity will cause it to fall. The program waits until
 * the user Shift-idles the WAM and then exits.
 * Terminating the program early (for example, by pressing Ctrl-C) will cause a
 * heartbeat fault. Pressing an E-stop button will cause the program to
 * terminate with an unhandled exception. If either of these occur, simply
 * Shift-idle the WAM and it will again be ready to use.
